# Hammerspoon
My Hammerspoon config files

## Installation

clone this project into your local git repo. I use ~/git/dotfiles/Hammerspoon
Create a symlink it to ~/.hammerspoon

Install the "SpoonInstall" Spoon in order to bootstrap the rest of the configuration
## What it does

My Hammerspoon setup does a number of things
* Sets up hot keys to allow me to resize and throw my windows around between screens
* Has an override for websites that block paste functions
* Triggers a shortcut when someone starts or stops the camera. I use this to turn on and off focus modes
